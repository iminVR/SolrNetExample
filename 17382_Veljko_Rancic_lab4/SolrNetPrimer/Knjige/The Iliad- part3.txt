jealously watched, and the motives of the writer form as important an
ingredient in the analysis of his history, as the facts he records.

demands. In brief, to write a history, we must know more than mere
facts. Human nature, viewed under an induction of extended experience,
is the best help to the criticism of human history. Historical
characters can only be estimated by the standard which human
experience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form
